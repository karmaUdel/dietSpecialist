---Let's start Server
	Server started at address :  http://127.0.0.1:5000/
	
	Let's load landing page of website
	But before that I'll give you idea about the website
	
	Idea: BAsed on the patient's history record, system will tell diet plan.. so let's go on and start the demo
	
	this is landing page
	
	1. We'll start with exception, i.e patient who is not their in files/databases
	
	Name :aaxcv, aqwer

    Ideal output : No records are founds
    Output : No records found
Matches the expected

2. Let's try some existing patient
   Name : Keith Gay Marshall
   Output : Record found 
   Actual output : Date of visit was old, so system didn't suggest any particular diet
                   Cool!

3. Let's try someone who might need diet ..
   Name  : Dolores Marshall
   Output : diet suggested
  Actual output : All of her visit were because of some allergies
           So system suggests to avoid eating allergy causing agents

4. Let's try one more
   Name : Jacqueline Spears Waller
   output : Diet suggested
   Actual output : Even Jacqueline was allergic to something whne she was treated
            so System suggested to avoid eating allergy casusing agents

5. Let's try some healthy patient

Name :  Lorenzo, Hector  i liked this name :D
  Output : No records found as this patient is healthy
  Actual output: Wooh ! He is healthy --> No records founds
  
  System can suggest 9 such diets but due to limit on time couldn't explore more patients
 As database is still under construction

But Let me show you all categories system looks for so far 
 9 like I said before
 
This concludes this demo

I used Following API for this projects : 52.200.214.141:8080/fhir/baseDstu3
